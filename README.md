# AI-Powered-Real-Time-PPE-Detection

## Problem Identification and Importance of HSE Goals:

The current manual process of monitoring PPE compliance on the assembly line poses operational risks and challenges in meeting Cummins' Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) goals. Automating this process is essential for improving worker safety and operational efficiency.

## Current Situation and Need for Automation:
Currently, PPE compliance is monitored manually, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. There is a need to automate the monitoring process to ensure consistent and accurate enforcement of safety protocols.

## Market Research and Vision AI Usage:
Market research indicates that many companies are successfully using Vision AI to enhance safety and compliance. This project leverages these insights to implement a similar solution using advanced object recognition technology.

## Project Implementation:

	• AI Model Building: We accumulated data and developed an AI model using YOLOv9 for effective PPE detection.
 
	• UI Development: Designed and developed UI mockups to create an intuitive interface for monitoring and reporting.
 
	• BI Dashboard Development: Created an analytics dashboard using Power BI to visualize data from the AI model, facilitating real-time decision-making.
 
	• Solution Implementation: The solution is being implemented at Cummins to streamline PPE monitoring and improve safety outcomes.
 
## YOLOv9 vs. Azure Vision AI and Agile Implementation:
Comparison: Evaluated the benefits and limitations of using YOLOv9 versus Azure Vision AI, considering factors like accuracy, integration, and cost.

Implementation Timeline: Adopted an agile methodology, breaking the project into sprints to ensure iterative development and timely delivery.
